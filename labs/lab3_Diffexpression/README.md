# 💻 Lab 3: Differential Gene Expression Analysis with DESeq2

## 📋 Objective
In this lab, you'll learn how to:
- Load processed RNA-seq count data from the previous lab
- Perform differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2
- Visualize results with MA plots and PCA
- Annotate genes with symbols and descriptions

## 📂 What to Do
> 🧠 You will complete this lab using the provided R Markdown template: `lab3_TEMPLATE.Rmd`

## 📝 Notes
- Use `message = FALSE` in code chunks to suppress unnecessary output during knitting.
- Create a dedicated results folder to organize your output files.
- Use **clear comments** explaining the biological and statistical meaning for each step.

## 🚀 Output
You should produce a knitted **HTML report** 

---

## 📦 Files Provided
- `lab3_TEMPLATE.Rmd` – Starter file for your report. Create your own copy and name it `lab3_DESeq2.Rmd`
- Data files from Lab 2: `txi_***_data.rds` and `design_table.rds`

---

## 📊 Expected Results
- Results folder with organized output files:
  - MA plot 
  - PCA plot 
  - TSV files containing annotated gene lists for further analysis
